## Ideas
### Cost computation in feature space 
* on the features extracted from point projection

### Feature track optimization with master sfm 
- [x] 
 <!-- ### Voxel hashing -->
### Keypoint = 3D point + color change
### Loss regularizer on 3d rotation in videos
### Track refinement in pose estimation for videos ?
### Include lots of points when triangulating
1. generate new un-triangulated points via dense matching
### The scene graph could be represented by an GNN
### Schur trick with scene graph
