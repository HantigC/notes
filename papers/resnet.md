## Abstract

* Leads to 8x depper than [[VGG](vgg.md)].
* 1st place on ILSVRC 2015 classification task.

## Introduction

Depth is of crucial importance. Deeper networks can't be achieved by simply
stacking multiple layers, this can lead to vanishig/exploding gradients, which
hampers the convergence. Another problem which occurs when training deeper networks is accuracy saturation.
